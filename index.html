              <p>
                Aidan Quigley embarked on a mission to familiarize himself with a series of programming languages in the spring of 2020.
                He found himself with a considerable amount of time on his hands due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and an untimely accident while snowboarding.
                In fashion with the rest of his life he funneled his significant energies into gaining a deeper understanding of programming and expaning his toolset of skills.

                Prior to his foray into programming, Aidan studied at the University of California Berkeley which conferred him a degree in Economics and Molecular and cell biology in just three years.
                He then left the United States for Ecuador where he lived in the small barrio of Nay√≥n just outside the capital city of Quito.
                For months Aidan immersed himself in the studies of Spanish and Mountaineering returning to the United States with a fluency in big mountain climbing and a working understanding of Spanish language.
                He then proceeded to pursue a career in Molecular Biology, specifically working on methods of reagent delivery in genome engineering settings, while audibling slightly from mountaineering to rockclimbing.
